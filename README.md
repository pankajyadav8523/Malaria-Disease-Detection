# Malaria_disease_detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately detect malaria from peripheral blood smear images. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the model uses Matplotlib for data visualisation and Grad-CAM for generating heat maps that provide visual explanations of the model’s predictions.
The model is deployed on Streamlit, a powerful tool that creates an interactive and user-friendly interface. This deployment allows healthcare professionals to easily upload blood smear images and receive instant diagnostic feedback. The simplicity of Streamlit’s interface makes the technology accessible even to those without a deep technical background, ensuring that doctors and medical staff can quickly and effectively use the model in their workflow. This capability is particularly crucial in resource-limited settings, where it aids in the timely and accurate diagnosis of malaria, potentially saving lives by accelerating the treatment process.
